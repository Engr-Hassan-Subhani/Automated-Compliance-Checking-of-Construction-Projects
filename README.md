# Advancing Machine Interpretability of Building Regulations: A Two-Phase Machine Learning Approach for Single-Clause Classification
Transforming Building Regulations into machine-readable formats is essential for the automated compliance checking (ACC) of construction projects. The field of Automated Rule Interpretation (ARI) has long focused on this task, yet existing methods largely rely on initial, manual identification of interpretable clauses. The concept of machine interpretability, the capacity of a clause to be converted into a format processable by computers, remains underexplored, especially at the level of individual or single clauses, which typically contain specific, detailed information or a rule that pertains to a particular aspect of building design, construction, safety, or compliance. This study introduces a groundbreaking approach to automatically evaluate and enhance the machine interpretability of single clauses within British and Finnish Building Regulations. The methodology involves a two-phase classification process. Initially, clauses are identified as either self-contained or non-self-contained, thus interpretable without external references, or not. This distinction is instrumental for the subsequent machine processing of these regulations. The self-contained clauses are further classified into subjective, numerical, and combined categories. This step is essential for practitioners, enabling quick identification of clauses suitable for direct automation and highlighting those requiring human intervention. This study used a dataset of over 25,000 single clauses from the British and the English translation of the Finnish Building Regulations for the initial phase of binary classification, categorising each sentence as either self-contained or non-self-contained. From this dataset, a subset of $1000$ clauses, which were identified as self-contained in the first phase, were further used in the second phase for a detailed trinary classification, categorising each clause as either subjective, numerical, or combined. This dataset was carefully annotated and curated manually, serving as a reliable ground-truth basis for research in this domain. Utilising this dataset, we applied several machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest, SVMs and Logistic Regression, complemented by different feature extraction techniques such as TF-IDF and Word2Vec. BERT was also used as a classifier to confirm its effectiveness in textual analysis in domain-specific natural language. These classifiers were rigorously evaluated using a 5-fold cross-validation method, yielding high accuracy rates â€“ surpassing 99% with TF-IDF features and reaching 97% with BERT.
